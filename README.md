# XGBoost vs MLP in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Potency Prediction
A mini research project benchmarking the performance of XGBoost and MLPs performance on the dataset used in the Asap discovery x OpenADMET hackathon. TL;DR: XGBoost outperforms MLPs, particularly using only a few (~8) molecular descriptors. Optimised model performance is comparable to challenge winners.
